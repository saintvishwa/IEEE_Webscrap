# IEEE_Webscrap
Research papers is best way to demonstrate any topic to all world and now many people are publishing their research  papers in different websites such as IEEE etc.
A research paper is an essay in which you explain what you have learned  after exploring your subject in depth.
In this you include information from resources such as books, articles, interviews,  and websites. You also use your own ideas, knowledge, and opinions. 
In different colleges teachers and students are publishing their papers on the internet but it's huge in numbers and so it  takes a huge amount of time to keep a record of each and every paper. 
For that automation is a good way which helps us to  save a lot of time and our work. 
So this system is to automate this work i.e. to keep record of every research paper with a  single link of that paper. 
With help of link / URL given this system uses selenium with python for web scraping which gets  different attributes related to papers like author, data, ISSN, DOI, title, publication etc. 
this data helps us to keep record of  every paper and gives information about that papers in short. 
So by using xpath and other selenium html parser we get  that data and save it in a data frame. 
After that this system create a csv file of that data and pre-process it with different  pre processing techniques like checking empty values, data transformation, visualization and correlation analysis.

It will help people to reduce workload of manual data entry. Instead of manual data entry for every paper details in excel file we just provide a few Paper IDs and then this project will automate extracting data from website and will save it in excel file after preprocessing.
